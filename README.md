## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I have learned


Over the course of this project, I developed my Flexbox skills and learned to use them effectively. In addition, I learned how to design the numbering in an ordered list. I have expanded my technical skills and am now able to give and receive feedback, which has been extremely valuable for both my personal and professional development.


### Further development


In the future, I plan to continue improving my CSS skills, especially when it comes to Flexbox and Grid. My goal is to create more complex websites and make them more engaging. In addition, I would also like to work on my skills in creating animations and develop myself further in this area. I'm currently in the process of learning Javascript so I can use it in my projects.
